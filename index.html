                    <p class="content-text">LJ STAND has been working as a team since 2016. In 2016, we built two custom soccer robots which we entered into the RoboCup Junior Australia competition. The 2016 robots had 12 IR sensors, 8 light sensors, an IMU, a camera, 3 motors, and were powered by an Arduino Mega.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="content-text">This year, we are building two more robots which are a significant upgrade over the 2016 robots. With  more powerful motors, more sensors, and faster processors, we have designed our robots to compete in the highest level of RoboCup Junior, the international competition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="content-text">In the spirit of RoboCup Junior, we have released all our 2016 designs and code for anyone interested in looking at them, and are avaliable on GitHub.</p>
